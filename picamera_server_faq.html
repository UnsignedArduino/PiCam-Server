          A:
        </b>
        There are a couple options you could go for. You should proceed in the order listed.
      </p>
      <ol style="font-family:courier;" class="center">
        <li>
          Refresh the page.
        </li>
        <li>
          Try both the 
          <a href="mobile.html">mobile</a>
          and
          <a href="index.html">desktop</a>
          versions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure that you actually 
          <i>
            showed
          </i>
          the stream by 
          <i>
            pressing
          </i>
          the button that says 
          <button alt="Click to show the stream">
            Click to show the stream
          </button>
          .
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure your browser can support MJPEG streams. If you are using something like Internet Explorer, update to a more "modern" browser. I suggest 
          <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">
            Chrome.
          </a>
        </li>
        <li>
          Closing and re-opening your browser.
        </li>
        <li>
          Restarting your device.
        </li>
        <li>
          Wait a couple minutes (or an hour). Sometimes, the server might be offline because of something as simple as a system update.
